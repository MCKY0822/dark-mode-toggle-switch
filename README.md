# Dark Mode Toggle Switch

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to create a simple yet stylish dark mode toggle switch using HTML, CSS, and SVG. The toggle allows users to switch between a light and dark theme with smooth animations, providing a visually appealing and functional user interface element. The toggle switch features custom-designed sun and moon icons that animate smoothly when toggled.

### Key Features:
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Easily switch between light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design**: The toggle is responsive and adapts to all screen sizes.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The switch features smooth transitions between the light and dark mode states.
- **Custom SVG Icons**: Sun and moon icons used for the toggle switch are sourced from [SVGRepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).

## Demo

A live demo of the dark mode toggle switch is available on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/MCKY0822/pen/PwYWLpW). 

## How It Works

The toggle is powered by a simple checkbox input, styled to look like a switch. When the checkbox is checked, the background color of the page changes, transitioning to a dark theme. The icons (sun and moon) inside the toggle switch also change based on the theme, providing a clear visual cue of the current mode.
